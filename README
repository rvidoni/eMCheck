eMCheck, encrypt Mail Checker, check for new email in gmail.com, yahoo.com and other accounts.
eMCheck is an encrypted shell script tested in FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Debian Linux and depends on fetchmail.

eMCheck print 4 fields: 
	"Start #" session mail number.
	"Now #" last check new mail.
	"In #" session new mail.
	"Inbox" total mail on the server.

The scripts with sensitive data are OpenSSL encrypted with salted password, cipher aes-256-ctr, Message Digest sha256.


USAGE
sh path/to/directory/eMC.sh  or  ./path/to/directory/eMC.sh if the script is executable (chmod +x eMC.sh)

Before run eMCheck some homework must be done:
	- Change the eMCheck default password with one more secure and encrypt it to create eMCheck.esh
	- Modify the eMCdata according to your mail accounts and encrypt it to create eMCdata.esh


FILES
eMCheck consist in two scripts and one data file that must to be in the same directory.

1) eMC.sh : a simple launcher that ask for the eMCheck's password.

2) eMCheck.esh : an encrypted shell script that check connectivity, feed fetchmail with accounts data, write a mail report in the reports sub-directory then count out and paste the final report.

eMCheck user options are:

- eMCheck time interval in seconds, e.g.:  export SLEEPSEC=600 (10  minutes) [1]
- eMCheck check for connectivity and DNS resolution. The domain can be [2] different, e.g.: google.com, cloudflare-dns.com, etc.
- Next check time: differences in date(1) require to [3] uncomment the command for FreeBSD / OpenBSD or Debian Linux.
The number in the square brackets [*] refer to the options position in the script.


eMCheck new password and encryption.
Please, change the default password with one more secure:
	a) change the default password in eMCheck:  cat eMCheck | sed 's/PASSWORD/new_pssw/g' > eMCheck.sh
	b) check the new password:  sdiff -s eMCheck eMCheck.sh
	c) now encrypt eMCheck.sh with OpenSSL:  openssl aes-256-ctr -md sha256 -k new_pssw <> eMCheck.sh > eMCheck.esh


3) eMCdata.esh : an encrypted fetchmailrc file with accounts data.
Write it or use fetchmailconf, a Python-based GUI to configure fetchmail, to create a fetchmailrc file.

eMCdata example, please change the accounts data according, e.g.:

set postmaster "username"
set bouncemail
set no spambounce
set softbounce
set properties ""

# Gmail.com example
poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3
user 'user.test@gmail.com' there with password 'password' is 'user.test' here options keep ssl sslcertck

# Yahoo.com example
poll pop.mail.yahoo.com with proto POP3
user 'user.name@yahoo.com' there with password 'password' is 'user.name' here options keep ssl sslcertck


Ref.: man fetchmail.
The latest HTML FAQ is available alongside the latest fetchmail sources at the fetchmail home page: http://www.fetchmail.info/


After writing the accounts data encrypt eMCdata using the new password:  

	openssl aes-256-ctr -md sha256 -k new_pssw <> eMCdata > eMCdata.esh


Note: gmail.com require extra setup, log in and go to Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab and set:
Enable POP for mail that arrives from now: ON
Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox. 
Save the Changes


NOTES
* At the first run the script will complain about some errors: terminate the script (Ctrl+C) and run it one more time. 
* Please, change the default password with one more secure.
* Do not change eMCheck directory name or path when the script is running.
* Terminate eMCheck (Ctrl+C) in order to add or remove an account, change eMCheck directory name or path.
* Vim text editor with the right group of autocommands can edit encrypted files.


TODO
- Rewrite eMCheck using AWK to reduce temp files.
- Check the "IN #" data source to avoid confusion after deleting mails. [Stauts: testing]
- Add section to manage slow connections errors and fetchmail authorization failure message.
- Shell script to download email headers and few lines to delete undesired. [Status: starting]
- Add 2 Factor Authentication. 
- eMCheck run from memory disk (ramdisk) with reserved or protected memory: OS related. [Status: documentation]


DEPENDENCIES
eMCheck depends on fetchmail - fetch mail from a POP, IMAP, ETRN, or ODMR-capable server.

eMCheck use standard commands: sh(1), readlink(1), dirname(1), openssl(1), mkdir(1), cat(1), sed(1). ping(8), chmod(1), tail(1), awk(1), date(1), rm(1), clear-tput(1), printf(1), echo(1), cd(1), sdiff(1), paste(1), find(1), ls(1), xargs(1) and builtin(1).

eMCheck was tested in FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE-p9, OpenBSD 6.6 GENERIC.MP#8, Debian Linux 9.12.
